		<h2>The Continuous Existence of Gender Differences In Public Opinion</h2>
		<p> In Today’s world there remains a visible gender difference among society where women and men hold different attitudes and opinions in American Politics. 
			There has been a long trajectory with the stereotypes of men and women in society as a whole. 
			From women being normalized to like the color pink and men to be normalized from society to like the color blue. 
			Where women have to act a certain way & guys another way. 
			Where women are seen as too “emotional” and “liberal” and men seen as “aggressive.” 
			Therefore these differences are long seen in society. 
			Most Importantly, in the world of Politics Gender and opinion in policy issues illustrates the differences of who favors what and why. 
			There being differences within welfare, abortion, and environmental rights.

			Women support causes of abortion to be a personal matter, support spending for assistance of the poor, and regulations for society, but it’s still not equal and can be attained because of the differences in politics gender. 
			Although Republican Conservative views do not support causes as much as Democrats both political parties have differences within gender and race. 
			It's important to understand how these gender differences in public opinion are creating an unbalanced system of choices.
