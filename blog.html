		<h2>The Continuous Existence of Gender Differences In Public Opinion</h2>
		<p> In Today’s world there remains a visible gender difference among society where women and men hold different attitudes and opinions in American Politics. 
			There has been a long trajectory with the stereotypes of men and women in society as a whole. 
			From women being normalized to like the color pink and men to be normalized from society to like the color blue. 
			Where women have to act a certain way & guys another way. 
			Where women are seen as too “emotional” and “liberal” and men seen as “aggressive.” 
			Therefore these differences are long seen in society. 
			Most Importantly, in the world of Politics Gender and opinion in policy issues illustrates the differences of who favors what and why. 
			There being differences within welfare, abortion, and environmental rights.
		</p>

			A social welfare system offers help to individuals and families in need, 
			with such programs as health care assistance, food stamps, and unemployment compensation.

		<ul>
			<li>Again, gender differences are larger among Republicans and almost non-existent among Democratic respondents.</li>
			<li>Democratic Men and Republic Men vote higher that by law abortion should be allowed in cases of domestic violence rather than personal choice. But There are other factors that lead to a woman's decision.</li>

		<h3>What do you all think about the matter?</h3>
		<p>
			Race, Gender, and Politics come together when establishing Gender Differences. 
			Women Involved in political offices want to establish policies that can benefit the society. 
			But within Democratic Males and Republicans Male there is still a restriction and differences on public opinion. 
			Women support causes of abortion to be a personal matter, support spending for assistance of the poor, and regulations for society, but it’s still not equal and can be attained because of the differences in politics gender. 
			Although Republican Conservative views do not support causes as much as Democrats both political parties have differences within gender and race. 
			It's important to understand how these gender differences in public opinion are creating an unbalanced system of choices.
